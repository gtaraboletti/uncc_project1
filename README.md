# uncc_project1UNCC FinTech BootCamp Project 1 ## Summary ##This project took a look at the amount of money spent per student (on average) in each state and compared that amount to various outcomes(including crime rates, test scores, and unemployment). Our aim was to see how strong the correlation between "money spent per student" and these other outcomes is. Our data covers the time period from 2015 through 2016. View conclusions by following the Google Slides link below## Libraries and/or Packages Used ##numpy as nppandas as pdhvplot.pandassqlalchemyPath from pathlib%matplotlib inlinematplotlib.pyplot as pltplotly.express as pxholoviews as hv##Contributors## Giselle Taraboletti - Slides 1-16	~Code file: GT_new_analysis.ipynbAditya Das - Slides 17 & 18	~Code file: ADproject1finalcode.ipynb## Google Slides Link to Presentation ##https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1c3v6qzSmK0PruIZ_lUwqDiXqlMVKxO_6/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116903043128448252371&rtpof=true&sd=true## Help from Online ##Adding labels above bars on bar chart: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58900736/adding-value-labels-to-hvplot-barCreating a dictionary with key value pair of State_Name : State_Abbreviation for use in Choropleth Maps https://medium.com/geekculture/create-a-choropleth-map-of-state-unemployment-rates-with-plotly-1354050e0cfd## License ##MIT LicenseCopyright (c) [year] [fullname]Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
