"Table 26. Needing But Not Receiving Treatment at a Specialty Facility for Substance Use in the Past Year, by Age Group and State: Estimated Numbers (in Thousands), Annual Averages Based on 2018 and 2019 NSDUHs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: Respondents were classified as needing substance use treatment if they met the criteria for an illicit drug or alcohol use disorder as defined in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) or received treatment for illicit drug or alcohol use at a specialty facility (i.e., drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility [inpatient or outpatient], hospital [inpatient only], or mental health center). Needing But Not Receiving Substance Use Treatment refers to respondents who are classified as needing illicit drug or alcohol treatment, but who did not receive illicit drug or alcohol treatment at a specialty facility. Illicit Drug Use includes the misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics or the use of marijuana, cocaine (including crack), heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants, or methamphetamine. Misuse of prescription psychotherapeutics is defined as use in any way not directed by a doctor, including use without a prescription of one's own; use in greater amounts, more often, or longer than told; or use in any other way not directed by a doctor. Prescription psychotherapeutics do not include over-the-counter drugs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: State and census region estimates, along with the 95 percent Bayesian confidence (credible) intervals, are based on a survey-weighted hierarchical Bayes estimation approach and generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques. For the ""Total U.S."" row, design-based (direct) estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals are given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"NOTE: The column labeled ""Order"" can be used to sort the data to the original sort order.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NOTE: Estimated numbers appearing as 0 in this table mean that the estimate is greater than 0 but less than 500 (because estimated numbers are shown in thousands).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
